[X] Ethereum book chapter 2 notes: 
- Read some but didnt feel like it was as valuable to me since I already have a background in it. 

[X] Ethereum book chapter 3 notes: 

-  Currently, there are six main implementations of the Ethereum protocol, written in six different languages:

1. Parity, written in Rust (most popular)

2. Geth, written in Go (most popular)

3. cpp-ethereum, written in C++

4. pyethereum, written in Python

5. Mantis, written in Scala

6. Harmony, written in Java

Side note: still need to set up my own eth node from this chapter.
